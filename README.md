# LightBnB - By: Kyle McParland (Lighthouse Labs 2024)

LightBnB is a web application designed to replicate the core functionalities of Airbnb, providing a platform for users to browse and book properties. This project served as a practical exercise in back-end and database technologies, including PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express, and JavaScript.

## Installation

- Clone **LightBnB** using the SSH key in the git repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kylemcparland/LightBnB.git
cd lightbnb
```

- Next, using your **RDBMS** of choice (postgreSQL in my case), initialize the local database using `migrations/01_schema.sql.` Populate the database using `seeds/02_seeds.sql.`

```bash
\i migrations/01_schema.sql
\i seeds/02_seeds.sql
```

- Finally, navigate to the LightBnB_WebApp directory and install dependencies using `npm install` ( full list documented on bottom of README.md ):

```bash
cd LightBnB_WebApp
npm install
```

## How to use
- Initialize the development web server using `npm run local`. The app will be served at [port 3000](http://localhost:3000/) by default.
```bash
npm run local
...
"listening on port 8080 ðŸ˜Ž"
```
- Connect locally using the url http://localhost:3000/ in your browser!

_How the database is structured behind the scenes. There are some additional tables to allow the project's scope to grow!_
